# PAN — Personal AI Network

PAN is a persistent AI operating system across all devices, projects, and conversations.

## Architecture (as of 2026-03-20)

### Three layers:
1. **Phone App** (Android/Kotlin) — always-listening voice assistant, on-device commands, routes to server
2. **PAN Server** (Node.js, port 7777) — runs as Windows service, bridges phone to Claude CLI, manages projects/sessions/memory
3. **Hardware Pendant** (ESP32-S3) — wearable with camera, mic, sensors, screen — streams to phone via BLE (in development)

### Phone App (`android/`)
- **STT**: Google Streaming Speech Recognition (real-time, replaced Whisper)
- **AI Classification**: GeminiBrain attempts on-device Gemini Nano (not yet working on Pixel 10 Pro), falls back to server
- **Local commands**: time, date, battery, flashlight, timer, alarm, navigation, search, phone app launching, media controls, mute/unmute
- **Server commands**: PC file operations, project terminals, complex questions
- **TTS**: Android TextToSpeech with quality voice selection
- **Echo prevention**: STT pauses during TTS, echo stripping for overlap
- **Dedup**: prevents duplicate STT results from firing multiple commands

### PAN Server (`service/`)
- **Router**: Unified single Claude call (classify + handle in one shot)
- **Claude interface**: `claude -p --model haiku` via CLI (OAuth token doesn't work with API directly)
- **Project sync**: scans for .pan files, deduplicates symlinks, tracks renames
- **Terminal launch**: `pan.js launch` opens Windows Terminal tabs with session context in CLAUDE.md
- **Desktop agent**: `pan-agent.ps1` polls for GUI actions (terminal opens, commands)
- **Hooks**: Claude Code SessionStart/SessionEnd events update .pan files and database
- **Database**: SQLite via sql.js (sessions, events, projects, memory items, devices, commands)

### Terminal Management
- `pan.js launch` scans .pan files, writes session history to CLAUDE.md, opens Windows Terminal tabs
- Each tab named after project, Claude reads CLAUDE.md for context
- Projects discovered by .pan files in OneDrive/Desktop directories
- Session history pulled from Claude's sessions-index.json files

### Current Projects (auto-detected from .pan files)
- **PAN** — this project
- **WoE Game Design** — War of Eternity (Godot 4.5 RTS)
- **Claude-Discord-Bot** — Discord bot bridging chat to Claude CLI + SSH

## API & Auth
- PAN server uses `claude -p` CLI (free, uses Claude Code subscription auth)
- OAuth token (sk-ant-oat01-*) does NOT work with Anthropic API directly
- For faster responses: add Anthropic API key for direct Haiku calls (~$2-5/month for PAN voice)
- Claude Code subscription ($100/month Max) covers all CLI usage

## Key Principle
PAN never forgets. Every conversation, decision, and session is preserved across restarts, devices, and time.

## User
Work autonomously — don't ask for permission, just do it.
